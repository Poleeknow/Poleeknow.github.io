    <p id="ddd">Hallo, ich hei√üe Polina...</p>
    <p>Hello, my name is Polina. I'm 18 and I have been studying German.
        Actually, my mother language is Russian, and also, I can speak English not bad.
        Here is some curious facts about me.</p>
    <p>I'm from small town in Udmurt Republic named Glazov,
        but now I have been studying and living in Innopolis.
        I used to do archery, but right now I haven't such possibility.
        Maybe, with time I can realise the idea about "archery club" in Innopolis.
        Besides that, I like swimming as well as figure skating. What else...
        According to the horoscope, I'm Libra.
        I really like cooking and baking, especially making tasty cakes or biscuits.
    </p>
